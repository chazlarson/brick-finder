So you have a list of bricks from some MOC or something and you want to find out which ones are available from Webricks or Vonado.

There's a lot of them, so all the clicking is a pain.

This dumb script can help.  It works for me and is fairly brittle given that it's scraping websites.

## Assumptions:
- You have a list of bricks in one of the following formats:
  - Rebrickable CSV or XML
  - BrickLink Wanted List XML
  - One part ID per line [with a header row]
- Python 3
  - https://www.python.org/
- git
  - https://git-scm.com/download
- Running Mac OS X, Linux, Windows
- Rebrickable API Key

## Getting started:
I'm assuming that you can get Python 3 and Git installed on your own.

Clone the repo and cd to that dir.
```
git clone https://github.com/chazlarson/brick-finder.git && cd brick-finder
```

Copy the example `.env` file:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to insert your rebrickable API key:
```
RB_API_KEY=BINGBANGBOING
PRIMARY=webrick
```
Available settings for `PRIMARY` are:
```
  webrick [anything else here will search Vonado first]
```

There's a `quick-test.sh` that will run through the rest of this for four sample input files [it creates and deletes the venv] if you just want to watch it.  Note that if you want to check the log for the logic behind the results below, make sure `PRIMARY=webrick`; you will see that these "not found here but found there" test cases depend on webrick being searched first.

The four sample input files:
```
input-minimal.txt.sample    # simple list of part numbers, no color or quantity
input.txt.sample            # Rebrickable inventory csv
input.xml.sample            # Rebrickable inventory xml
input.bricklink.xml.sample  # Bricklink Wanted List XML [Primary difference to RB XML is in the color numbers]
```

The sample input files contain a few different cases [as of this writing; things may change].  Of course, the color-related details don't apply to the minimal case.

```
Part,Color,Quantity
30150,84,81   # part not available on webrick, available on vonado with correct color
6060,70,9     # part not available on webrick, available on vonado but not in the requested color
10169,70,40   # part available on webrick in the wrong color; not available from vonado in correct color, either
15573,28,17   # part available on webrick under alternate mold
4732,72,2    # part not available on either
30374,9999,1 # Part requested in "Any Color"
3648,19,22   # Rebrickable doesn't recognize this part, Bricklink does
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv brick-finder
source brick-finder/bin/activate
```
Windows?
```
python -m venv brick-finder
brick-finder\Scripts\activate
```

install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script:
```
python brick-finder.py -i input.txt.sample
```
If the input file is a Bricklink Wanted List XML, you need to specify `-l True` to tell the script that the input file contains Bricklink color numbers.
```
python brick-finder.py -i input.bricklink.xml.sample -l True
```

The terminal output shows Bricklink ID, URL, color status [or "Part Not Found":
```
$ python brick-finder.py -i input.txt.sample

## Notes:

This script invokes a search just like the search field on Webricks and Vonado [sequence depends on the `PRIMARY` setting] website.  If there are results returned, it then looks through them for a result where the part URL contains the part ID (without additional numbers) and does not contain "moc".  For example, if you're searching for "3004" you'll get these results:
- https://www.vonado.com/brick-1x2-3004.html
- https://www.vonado.com/cavity-w-leads-30046.html
- https://www.vonado.com/window-1x2x2-2-3-with-rounded-top-30044.html
- https://www.vonado.com/cavity-w-iron-lattice-30045.html
- https://www.vonado.com/plate-1x4-w-rev-hook-30043.html
- https://www.vonado.com/moc-30043-land-rover-defender-110.html

You only want the first, so a match is considered: "contains the part ID, preceded by a dash, followed by a dash or period"

In this specific case, the "moc" filter is redundant, but it could be that some MOC will have the same number as a part, so we explicitly skip them.

If a part is not found on the firs site, then the other is searched.
If a part is found on the first site, but not in the desired color, then the second is searched and the part info is only updated if the color is found on the second site.

You may want to search Webricks first because parts are sold by the each there.  Vonado parts are always lots of 10.  Personally I typically order from Vonado since I like building up the stock of spares.

The script grabs the alternate molds and IDs from rebrickable for each part and searches for those as well.  If rebrickable doesn't recognize the part, it searches bricklink for the part and any alternates.  This *should* mean that a "Part not found" truly means it is not found on either Webricks or Vonado.

# Color checking:

Vonado and Webrick appear to use the same server software; there's a javascript tag in the page that contains a JSON object listing available colors and prices for the part.  This script finds that tag, then parses the JSON object to extract color information.  This is of course fragile, but it's the best we have.  A previous version of this script loaded the page through Selenium and foudn the swatch block; that was abandoned since it was slower and didn't provide pricing information.

Webrick, especially, seems to run into sporadic trouble building that JSON object of colors and prices [in this case that script tag contains a PHP error rather than valid JSON].  For this reason, the script tries 12 [twelve] times to load the page and get a valid piece of color-listing JSON.  If that fails, there will be a note to this effect in the console output and the color availability will be "False". 

I haven't seen this happen with Vonado, at least not with the frequency that it happens with Webrick.

In the "Any Color" case, it loops through all the colors in which the part is available and picks the first one with the lowest price.  More often than not this is white since usually all the colors are the same price and white is the first color listed, if it is listed.  The log above shows a part where white *wasn't* the cheapest.

# Edge cases

There are some oddball parts I'm not handling well; for example:
https://www.vonado.com/flat-tile-1x2-3069-trans-clear.html

That page has no color chart, and no lot size.  The title of the page seems to indicate it's just one color, and pricing is in line with a lot of 10 of 1x2 plates:
https://www.vonado.com/plate-1x2-3023.html

so it's not exactly clear what to do with that.  It is the only result for 3069 1x2 tile on either site as of this writing.

## Future possibilities

- support for other sites
  - ~~webrick [looks to be same site backend as Vonado]~~
  - AliExpress [extracting results will be fragile]
  - GoBricks [may be a non-starter since it's in Chinese and doesn't appear to use common part numbers]
- Add parts to a shopping cart
- Read and/or produce Excel docs
- ~~support for exported BrickLink wanted list XML~~
- ~~local database to store alternate part numbers~~ [not needed, loaded on the fly]
- ~~Verify color availability [will require loading the page via selenium since the chart appears to be loaded by JS; also hampered by remarks above about vagary in color names and numbers]~~
- ~~Calc how many lots you need to buy~~
- ~~Make the input file parsing a little more robust.~~ Now uses Rebrickable CSV as default.
- ~~Calc ballpark cost~~
- ~~account for varying prices per part~~
- ~~pick the cheapest color for "Any Color" parts~~
